### Introduction:


Big data analysis in the manufacturing industry is mainly used to deal with massive data in various manufacturing activities, which has dramatically exceeded conventional data processing systems’ capability. Big data analytics is becoming increasingly popular among manufacturing companies. It is challenging to collect unstructured data, which usually comes from the Internet, event logs, multimedia social communication, etc. and needs innovative, practical technologies to capture, process, and manage them. Researchers used the latest techniques and methods from big data analysis, deep learning, and prediction. Most manufacturing workshops use the same sensors, and they provide similar data in the virtual workshop. The decision support system is designed to adapt to the manufacturing environment. The digital factory model (DFM) integrates the manufacturing information and knowledge about products and machines. [A]

Modern manufacturing facilities are data-rich environments that support the transmission, sharing and analysis of information across pervasive networks to produce manufacturing intelligence. The potential benefits of manufacturing intelligence include improvements in operational efficiency, process innovation, and environmental impact, to name a few. [B]

With the advances in new generation information technologies (New IT), especially big data and digital twin, smart manufacturing is becoming the focus of global manufacturing transformation and upgrading. Intelligence comes from data. Integrated analysis for the manufacturing big data is beneficial to all aspects of manufacturing. Besides, the digital twin paves a way for the cyber-physical integration of manufacturing, which is an important bottleneck to achieve smart manufacturing. In this paper, the big data and big data procession in manufacturing are reviewed, including their concept as well as their applications in product design, production planning, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance, etc. [C]

### Design of the smart factory:

Big data analysis is a revolutionary leap in traditional data analysis. The characteristics of big data can be summarized and defined by 5V ,viz. high capacity (a large amount of data), high speed (data generated and updated at high speed), high diversity (data generated by various sources appear in different forms), high accuracy and high value (tremendous potential value hidden in data). In the era of big data in the manufacturing industry, the unique characteristics of big data systems are real-time, dynamic and adaptive. [A]

Big data systems typically consist of six necessary subsystems: data generation, data acquisition, data transmission, data processing, storage, and analysis methods. The framework organically combines industrial network, cloud and supervision and control terminals with intelligent workshop objects (machines, conveyors and products, etc.), and divides intelligent object modeling into four types of agents, the process works efficiently through autonomous decision-making and distributes cooperation among agents, defines a central coordinator in the cloud for feedback and coordination, and proposes an intelligent negotiation mechanism to facilitate inter-agency collaboration. [A]

With the advances in the modern IT solutions such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Cloud computing, etc, it has brought valuable services and resources into the manufacturing industry. It is said that, around 20B devices are connected in 2020, due to which large volume of high-speed data of over 40ZB of structured, semi structured and unstructured data. With powerful storage and computing power of cloud computing, big  data  analysis models  and  algorithms are  run  to organize,  analyze,  and mine these raw data to obtain valuable knowledge.[C]

### Layers of the smart industry

The Layers of the smart industry is the ground up approach to the integration of intelligent individual systems with each other and how the information is transferred from one functional block to the other.

**Network Technologies**

Smart Manufacturing infrastructures have to be based on network technologies which enable a secure (encryption, authentication, robustness, safety), vertical and horizontal cross-domain and cross-layer communication between stationary and mobile objects (as virtual objects, sensors, actors, devices, things or systems). Network technologies have to comply with specific requirements related to e.g. real-time, safety, security, data amounts, wired or wireless, passive or active, etc.[D]

**Communication Protocols**

Communication protocols in smart manufacturing should enable a robust, loosely coupled, time-synchronized, secured, and semantically based communication. It is hardly possible in smart manufacturing infrastructures, where thousands of communicating objects are reachable from everywhere, to exchange information traditionally loop based via a bus in a defined frequency to enable a deterministic information exchange). That generates a need for new approaches to reduce the traffic in networks whilst holding on to all requirements. [D]

**Architectures**

Architectures, in general, are describing combinations of components/modules and their interaction, and should provide a unified structure and wording for used terms. An architecture should include a logical, a development, a process and a validation view, and should provide scenarios for a validation. A smart manufacturing architecture should also provide a unified structure and wording covering mandatory aspects in smart manufacturing as product, system or order life cycles, value streams, information flows, or hierarchical layers. Such architectures are currently under development.[D]

**Connectable Objects**

(Physical) reachable objects inside a smart manufacturing network (e.g. digitalised and virtualised field level devices, systems, material, integrated humans, virtual concepts (e.g. of products in the design phase), etc.), have to fulfil a range of requirements. Objects should communicate using a unified communication protocol, at least at the application level, and should be based on a unified semantic to enable a mutual identifiability and understanding. The object itself should provide its own features as a service (e.g. state information or functionalities), and should be able to provide its own description next to extended information as manuals, specifications or wear information.[D]

**Connectable Applications**

Finally, various applications that use services of deployed objects to realize e.g. control systems, systems of systems through service orchestration, or―as focused in this work―Big Data analysis applications can be implemented.[D]


### Components of Big data manufacturing

Data as a co-product of manufacturing: When data were manually recorded, the amount of data was low, the quality was inconsistent, and the associated value was little to support improvement of the manufacturing processes. As digital sensors have increasingly replaced manual data recording, and sensor-rich machines become commonplace on the factory floors, the availability of large amount of high-quality, high-value data has fundamentally shifted the role of data, making it an inseparable co-product of modern manufacturing [E]

**Data Collection:**

The availability and accessibility of data across the entire spectrum of manufacturing has grown at an unprecedented rate. These data can be broadly classified to five categories: 1) Management data from information systems, such as those related to production planning and inventory management; 2) Process data from sensors, e.g., on real-time machine performance; 3) User data from the written logs and online behaviors related to web browsing, purchasing, and review history; 4) Product data from its lifecycle related to performance and the context of use; 5) Public data from regulatory institutions through open databases, such as regulations and industrial standards [E]

| Big Data V’s  | Data Acquisition  | Data Transmission  | Data Management  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|  Volume | Process-embedded sensing design  | Compressive sensing  |Distributed storage: NoSQL database   |
| Velocity  |  High speed data acquisition: X-Ray imaging | Edge computing  | Distributed storage: NoSQL database  |
|  Variety |Multi-variate sensing design   | Acoustic wireless transmission | Semantic indexing  |
| Veracity  | Trust-incorporated sensing network  |  Redundancy reduction via compressive sensing|Data cleansing   |

**Data Processing:**

After data is acquired, transmitted, and stored, data analysis is performed to generate knowledge about the process. Data analysis methods can be classified into two categories depending on function: data processing and learning. Data processing is traditionally built on statistical models that aim at inferring process status and optimizing quality-related parameters. As data become more complex and applications more heterogeneous, these methods have gradually become insufficient and are increasingly enhanced by other techniques. Conversely, data learning aims to learn from data the patterns related to quality and has become increasingly important. With the continual increase in data volume and variety, the evaluation of data quality, e.g., uncertainty and redundancy, has also become a major focus of data processing [E]

Statistical methods in Big Data analysis are used e.g. for the identification of clusters in data, the identification of associations, or the analysis of regressions. Meaningful data as the identification of clusters and associations in data, potentially helps to understand how statistical obtained values correlates, and how they affect each other. Statistical methods are commonly used in manufacturing for scheduling and diagnosis, but are also regularly used on the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) level to establish mathematical correlations between their profits, expenditures and produced goods.[D]

Data correlation is anticipated when the same process is measured using multiple sensors. How to distinguish the complementary information from redundancy has been an active research topic. With big data, conventional correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson) can become ineffective since the relationship among variables is often nonlinear. Therefore, there is an increasing need for techniques to detect these relationships regardless of the forms. Researchers developed a procedure to compute Mutual Information (I(X,Y) can be interpreted as the change of information in X, before/after having knowledge of Y with a small MI indicating a weak relationship) for large-scale dataset, termed maximal information coefficient (MIC). The idea is that if a relationship exists between two variables, then a grid can be drawn on the scatter plot to partition the data to encapsulate the relationship. Specifically, to compute MIC, all grids up to a maximal resolution (subject to a predefined threshold) are explored and the largest MI for each grid is selected and normalized to the corresponding grid dimension. Then, MIC is the maximum of these selected values. In manufacturing, MI has been widely considered as an important criterion in feature selection, for which a threshold is typically set up to determine whether additional feature provides substantially more information than features already selected.

**Data Learning:**

[![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0007850620301359-gr19.jpg)](http://https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0007850620301359-gr19.jpg)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerns computational heuristic methods. An AI method is considered as such, if it is capable of learning something by its own means. This research field is often materialised in the form of Neural Networks (NN) and Decision Trees (DT) (two of the most intensively researched fields within AI). This field has a variety of applications in an equally wide spectrum of other research and enterprise areas. Concerning manufacturing, both NN and DT are widely used as diagnosis approaches, often as part of other self-learning paradigms. Behind classical manual diagnosis, individual diagnosis solutions are often used for manufacturing systems. Researchers are working on new approaches based on, for instance, automatic (predictive) failure detection through fault tree analysis (FTA), or self-learning approaches. These approaches handle also systems with a higher complexity (evolvable and emergent systems with changing physical and logical conditions and behaviours). FTA is a methodology for fault detection based on tree composed and linked logical Boolean functions. States which could result in a defined combination to an error, have to be identified through the FTA, and will result on of the top tree level in an error state (e.g. when an unwanted combination of sub-states appears) [D]
DL refers to a series of neural networks consisting of multiple layers, which allow the decomposition of complex data into multiple levels and the assembly of multi-level features layer-by-layer into a high-level representation. DL can be considered an extension to ANN with various structrures specifically designed for unstructured data types, such as image, as shown in Table 3. For example, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) consists of a series of convolutional layers for image analysis [E]

# **Methodology**

The methodology discusses about the types of processes the big data is used for predicting many things within the production domain.

### Machine Learning and AI models in Smart Industries

#### Graph Analysis:

The analysis of paths, connectivity, community, or centrality of/between objects inside a graph, are parts of graph analysis. Path analysis is used to proof reachability between two objects in a graph, to find a path with no repeating edge, to find cycles, or to find a shortest path between nodes. Connectivity analysis is used to provide answers of how strong an object is connected with other objects, how robust a graph is, or could provide answers of the similarity of graphs. Community analysis is used to identify objects that are often interacting (communities/clusters) and its evolution. Centrality analysis is used to get information about the importance of nodes (e.g. in case that a node is connected to many other nodes, which could be an indication of a high importance, or a single point of failure). Based on the specific use case in manufacturing (as already said, e.g. representation of IoT interactions, energy flows, processes or supply chains), such analyses can provide meaningful information about the analyzed system.[D]
In addition, the Dijkstra algorithm, a popular example in graph analysis, is very useful for finding shortest paths in smart manufacturing systems. A graph could represent a flexible transportation system, where it is necessary to find the shortest path between start and destination.[D]

### Decision making systems:

Big data analytic can create new competitive opportunities by extracting useful value and bringing advanced predictive insights into strategic process management, widely used in supply chain operations such as demand planning, procurement, production, inventory, and logistics. Big data analysis can improve manufacturing systems and help enterprises make wise decisions, such as product forecasting, enterprise performance management, product design, customer service, and so on. Big data can be used to improve the working efficiency of aging manufacturing systems. A new hierarchical dimension reduction method was proposed, and a probabilistic approach based on generalized distance measurement was developed to detect and avoid faults. [A]

## Application of Big data in Manufacturing:
The  data in manufacturing  is often  used  for operational purposes manufacturing organization. The figure below is how big data is used in the manufacturing and product identification and product path propagation...

![](../../../Desktop/dg.png)

**Preventive maintenance:**

Operational  efficiency  relies  on  the  availability  of  the machinery in the production  process. Manufacturers  can use the  best big data analytics software to  determine the status  of  the  machine.  This  approach  is  often  called preventive maintenance.  [F]
 
**Product Design:** 

Developing  new  products  can  be  expensive. Big  data analytic  software  can  analyze  data  and  help  identify trends and market changes that can be fed into the design of new products.  [F]

**Production Management Automation:**

Automation of the production management is probably the hardest way of using big data in manufacturing processes. A good example of production management automation is the case with GE’s wind turbines. Sensors provide data on energy generation and wind direction, according to which the blade  pitch is changed to optimize  the wind  turbine’s efficiency.  [F]

**Customer Experience:**

Excellent  customer  experience  has  become  an essential part  of  every  business.  The  big  data  analytics  solutions draw customer data from a wide variety of sources and use the data for in-depth data analysis.  [F]

**Supply Chain Improvement:** 

Timing is everything. Big data enables manufacturers to track the exact location of their products.  Modern supply chains are becoming increasingly complex. Big data analytic solutions deliver supply chain visibility to instantly know key supply chain  information.  Big  data can  provide  information about the supply chain and makes it possible to predict with greater certainty whether or not a supplier will deliver as agreed. It also increases transparency into the entire supply chain.[F].

## 	Challenges in big data manufacturing:

**Complexity1:** Due to the complex nature of manufacturing, adoption of latest technologies is always difficult.  [F]

**Environmental Issues:** Something drastic needs  to be done to reduce the adverse effects of manufacturing on the environment.  [F]

**Regulation Requirements:** The manufacturing industry inadvertently exposes itself to safety risks (to humans) arising out of industrial accidents.  [F]

**Product  Development  &  Innovation:**  Manufacturers must constantly innovate in order to stay relevant and compete.  [F]

**Preventive  Maintenance:**  Minimum  disruption  to business  operations  is  one  of  the  main  challenging tasks for manufacturers.  [F]

**Faster  Time-to-market:**  Manufacturers  have  a  very short time-span within which to launch their products, else they risk losing out to competitors.   [F]

**Market Volatility:** Market volatility constrains continuous product  performance,  thus  impeding  business performance.  [F]


**Huge  Data  &  Manual  Analysis:**  Manual  analysis  is inherently  time-consuming  and  risk-laden  (human errors).  [F]

**Judicious Use:**  Big data often leads managers to rely too much on the data and abdicate decision making. They need  to  be  judicious  in  their  use  of  data  especially around privacy and sensitivity concerns.  [F]

**Cyber Attacks:** With the increasing adoption of emerging technologies in the manufacturing industry, the security concerns are becoming significant. Manufacturing is one of the most targeted industries by cyber attackers owing to  the  presence  of  vital  data  related  to  company  and government,  making  manufacturers  subjected  to cybersecurity incidents.[F]

Big Data analysis in smart manufacturing is a newer topic and a list of challenges need to be tackled for a usable realization of potential Use Cases[D]

**Challenges related to the data:** How to handle growing volume, variety and velocity; growing complexity related to veracity (addressing impression, uncertainties, untruths, biases and missing values in the data) and volatility; how to measure the quality of data (completeness, availability, topicality); or, how to discover them in data streams.[D]

**Challenges related to processing a Big Data analysis:** How to acquire and record data in different data fidelities using smart filters and data reduction techniques; how to extract and clean information through extraction of right data, and put them into a suitable structure for data analysis; how to integrate and aggregate heterogenic data (automatically) in suitable databases; how to process queries, analyze and model heterogeneous, untrustworthy and noisy, inter-related and dynamic data; or, how to interpret and make available analysis outcomes.[D]

The below figure represents the technological gap between the current manufacturing systems and the Industry 4.0.[G]

## Conclusion:

In summary, it can be said that Big Data is not just a fashion term that will lose its meaning in the next couple of years. The growing amounts of data, the rising complexity of systems, the emerged technological possibilities to analyze big data amounts, and the huge potential value in these data leads to the expectation that Big Data analysis will get more and more in the focus of many areas. Smart Manufacturing is only one of them.[D]  The smart manufacturing systems have been playing a vital role in the implementation of better manufacturing technology in the current industrial age. The smart manufacturing technology improves the operational efficiency, productivity and has great impact in the global economy. It has been found that emergence of IoT and IIoT has been playing a vital role in uplifting the manufacturing system equipped with smart manufacturing systems. Various researches in manufacturing system have investigated that there are many industries which are intending to upgrade their industries with smart manufacturing systems.[G]
