# Big Data Processing in Manufacturing	

### Abstract

Understanding the significance of Big data and it's applications in Manufacturing and production industries. This research topic will discuss about the usage of big data in the current manufacturing industries, how are they utilized for the benefits of the industry and what are the outcomes of big data processing in manufacturing data. It will also discuss about insights of future big data applications in production companies that uses IoT, ML, and Data science for their product development and process improvements. We shall discuss the methodologies, current and future researches in the production sector that uses big data extensively in order to achieve the Industry 4.0 status

### Introduction:

In this section we answer the questions such as, what is Industry 4.0 or smart industries? How does these industries function? What  are connected services within the infrastructure of the company and how big data acts as a major role in the evolution of the new industrial era?

### Methodologies:

In this section we will discuss about the methodologies and processes, the big data services such as IoT devices are connected with each other and how the data flows with each devices interacting in order to achieve a collective purpose. We shall discuss how big data nature is represented through the 5V's and how the companies store, manipulate and retrieve the data for enabling smart industry services or the Industry 4.0 infrastructure.

### Big data management and applications of Big data for decision making:
In this section we are going to see how the big data is managed in the company such as utilization, inputs, storage, retrieval, and reporting. Also, we will discuss about the big data applications applications that major companies uses for visualizing live data dashboards and make decisions based on that.

### Future research

This section of the paper discusses about the future research opportunities and scope of improvements in the currently followed Industry 4.0 standards.
